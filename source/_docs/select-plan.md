Pantheon offers multiple service levels, called [Plans](https://www.pantheon.io/pricing). You can select the plan that works best for you and your needs. In the beginning, you can start on the Basic Plan. Then once you start to grow and have more specific requirements, take a look at the Pro Plan, which can be part of the recipe to get your site or application to scale and perform better.

To get started, select the site you would like to associate with a plan.

## Choose a Plan and Add a Payment Method

1. Select **Settings**, and choose the plan you want for the selected site.
2. Add a payment method or invite the site owner to pay for the site.  If you have already added a card to your account, select the card you want to use for billing.  
3. Once this is done, an email is sent to the account of the user who is associated with the credit card.

## Go Live
Now that you have selected a plan, continue the process of going live by [setting up a domain on your site](/docs/going-live).

## View Your Site's Plan

Identifying your site's service level is quick and easy. You can find this in the green label next your site's name.

<h4>Note</h4>
If you downgrade from a paid plan to sandbox, the <a href="/docs/">domains</a> you've added in your Live environment will be removed. You will need to re-add domains if you decide to return to a paid plan.</div>

## Manage Site Settings

After you get to your site's Dashboard, click the **Settings** link in the upper-right corner. This is where you can select add ons and see your current PHP version.
