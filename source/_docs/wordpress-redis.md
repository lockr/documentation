Currently, all plans except for Personal can use Redis. Redis is available to Sandbox plans for developmental purposes, but Redis will not be available going live on a Personal plan.



 | Plans        | Supported
 | ------------- |:-------------:|
 | Sandbox      | **Yes** |
 | Personal      | No      |
 | Professional | **Yes**      |
 | Business | **Yes**      |
 | Elite | **Yes**      |

## Enable Redis on the Pantheon Site Dashboard
First enable Redis from your Pantheon Site Dashboard by going to **Settings** > **Add Ons** > **Add**. It may take a couple minutes for the Redis server to come online.
## Install Drop-in Plugin
[WP Redis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/) is loaded via a drop-in file, so there's no need to activate it on your WordPress sites. The following installation methods are supported:
### Install via Symlink Drop-in
This method will store object cache values persistently in Redis while preserving the standard procedures for applying plugin updates.

1. Install the [WP Redis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/) plugin via SFTP, Git, or the following [Terminus](/docs/terminus) command:

 ```
 terminus wp 'plugin install wp-redis'
 ```
2. Using SFTP or Git, create a new file named `wp-content/object-cache.php` that contains the following:

 ```
 <?php
 # This is a Windows-friendly symlink
 require_once WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/plugins/wp-redis/object-cache.php';
 ```
3. Verify installation by selecting **Drop-ins** from the Plugins section of the WordPress Dashboard.

When a new version of the WP Redis plugin is released, you can upgrade by the normal Plugin update mechanism in WordPress or via Terminus:

```
terminus wp 'plugin update wp-redis'
```

### Install via Composer

1. Set the Dev environment's connection mode to Git from within the Site Dashboard or via Terminus:

 ```
 terminus site set-connection-mode --mode=git
 ```

2. [Clone the site's codebase](/docs/git/#clone-your-site-codebase) and initialize Composer with `composer init`, if you have not done so already.

3. Use the following within `composer.json` to install the WP Redis plugin as a drop-in via Composer using [koodimonni/composer-dropin-installer](https://github.com/Koodimonni/Composer-Dropin-Installer):

 ```json
 "repositories": {
   "wpackagist": {
     "type": "composer",
     "url": "https://wpackagist.org"
   }
 },
 "require": {
   "composer/installers": "^1.0.21",
   "koodimonni/composer-dropin-installer": "*",
   "wpackagist-plugin/wp-redis": "0.4.0"
   },
   "extra": {
     "installer-paths": {
       "wp-content/plugins/{$name}/": ["type:wordpress-plugin"],
       },
     "dropin-paths": {
        "wp-content": [
        "package:wpackagist-plugin/wp-redis:object-cache.php"
      ]
    }
  }
 ```

4. Run `composer install` to install WP Redis into the `wp-content` directory.  
5. Use git status to verify your local state, then commit and push your code to Pantheon:

 ```
 git status
 git commit -Am "Initiate composer, require custom code"
 git push origin master
 ```

## Use the Redis Command-Line Client

1. [Install Redis locally](http://redis.io/download).
2. From the Site Dashboard, select the desired environment (Dev, Test, or Live).
3. Click the **Connection Info** button, copy the Redis connection string, and run the command in your local terminal.

Execute the following command to return existing Redis keys:
```bash
redis> keys *
```
If Redis is configured properly, it will show the appropriate keys. If nothing is returned, proceed to the troubleshooting section below.

To check if a specific key exists, you can pass the exists command:
```bash
redis> SET key1 "Hello"
OK
redis> EXISTS key1
(integer) 1
redis> EXISTS key2
(integer) 0
redis>
```
## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Activate the Redis Plugin
WP Redis is a drop-in plugin that should only be loaded using the installation methods above. No activation is required.

### Redis Server is Gone
Enabled Redis via the Pantheon Site Dashboard by going to **Settings** > **Add Ons** > **Add** > **Redis**. It may take a few minutes to provision the service.
