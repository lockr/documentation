Drupal 8 allows users to easily define core services and environment-specific settings within the `sites/default/services.yml` configuration file, eliminating the need for hacks to swap functionality. Creating or modifying this file is not required when installing a new Drupal 8 site.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<h4>Warning</h4>
Due to environment-specific settings (e.g. Twig debug mode), <code>sites/default/services.yml</code> should only be created or modified via SFTP. This file should <strong>not</strong> be managed via Git, so that settings are not migrated between environments when pushing code.
</div>

## Change Permissions
Access your site's codebase via SFTP and temporarily make the `sites/default` directory writeable (read + write + execute). Change writable files, such as `default.services.yml`, to 666 (read + write). Depending on your SFTP client, change permissions using the 'get info' or 'file attribute' options.

For general SFTP instructions, see [Developing on Pantheon Directly with SFTP Mode](/docs/sftp/).
## Create and Modify services.yml
From within the `sites/default` directory, create a new file named `services.yml` by duplicating the existing `default.services.yml` file. Use your typical SFTP workflow to modify `services.yml` accordingly.
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>Note</h4>
Module specific services should be defined in a separate <code>.yml</code> file, located in the root directory of the respective module (e.g. <code>sites/all/modules/module_name/module_name.services.yml</code>).
</div>

## Restore Default Permissions
You will need to set the permissions back to default (555 for directories, 444 for files) once edits are complete. This file should remain non-writable for security concerns.
